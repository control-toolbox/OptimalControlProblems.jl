This repo is part of the [control-toolbox ecosystem](https://github.com/control-toolbox).
The control-toolbox ecosystem gathers Julia packages for mathematical control and applications. The root package is [OptimalControl.jl](https://github.com/control-toolbox/OptimalControl.jl) which aims to provide tools to modelise and solve optimal control problems with ordinary differential equations by direct and indirect methods.
